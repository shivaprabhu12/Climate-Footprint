# Climate-Footprint

This chat application, named "Llama," enables users to engage in conversations about their lifestyle choices and receive feedback on their environmental impact. Users can ask questions related to various aspects of their daily lives, such as transportation, energy consumption, and dietary habits.
Features
User Interaction: Users can type messages to inquire about how specific lifestyle choices affect climate change.
Bot Responses: The bot provides tailored responses based on user input, offering insights and suggestions for reducing their carbon footprint.
Real-Time Chat: The application supports real-time messaging, ensuring a smooth conversational experience.
Loading Indicators: Users are informed when the bot is processing their queries.
Implementation Steps
1. Setting Up the Environment
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed.
Create a new React app using Create React App or your preferred setup.
2. Building the Chat Interface
Create a ChatPage component that includes:
State Management: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage messages, input text, and loading states.
Message Structure: Define a Message type to represent messages sent by users and the bot.
3. Handling User Input
Implement a form for users to submit their questions:
javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!input.trim()) return;

  const userMessage = { id: Date.now(), sender: "user", text: input.trim() };
  setMessages((prev) => [...prev, userMessage]);
  setInput("");
  setLoading(true);

  // Fetch response from API
  const response = await fetch("/api/chat", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage.text }),
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const botMessage = { id: Date.now() + 1, sender: "bot", text: data.response || "Something went wrong" };
  
  setMessages((prev) => [...prev, botMessage]);
  setLoading(false);
};

4. API Integration
Set up an API endpoint (/api/chat) that processes user messages and returns relevant information about climate impact based on user inputs. This could involve:
Analyzing transportation habits (e.g., car vs. public transport).
Evaluating energy consumption patterns (e.g., electricity usage).
Providing dietary advice (e.g., plant-based vs. meat-heavy diets).
5. User Feedback Loop
Encourage users to ask follow-up questions or provide feedback on the suggestions given by the bot. This can help refine the responses and improve user engagement.
Example Interaction
User types: "How does driving my car affect my carbon footprint?"
Bot responds with an analysis of emissions from car usage compared to public transport options.
User can ask for tips on reducing their carbon footprint.
